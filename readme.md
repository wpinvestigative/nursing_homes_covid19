#Coronavirus cases in U.S. nursing homes

The Washington Post’s database contains the names of Medicare-certified nursing homes with at least one reported case of the coronavirus among patients or staff as of April 25, 2020.

The Post [began tracking providers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/20/nearly-one-10-nursing-homes-nationwide-report-coronavirus-outbreaks/) in early April when it became clear that nursing homes were at the center of the nation’s coronavirus pandemic. For weeks, the federal government and most states did not publicly report the names of facilities. By culling local news reports, health department data and recently released lists from states, The Post was able to identify more than 1,800 impacted nursing homes – 1 in 9 nationwide.

Using federal data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, The Post was also able to identify nursing homes cited more than once by inspectors since 2016 for violating federal standards meant to protect residents from the spread of infections.

The Post’s data is not complete. It will be updated weekly as more states begin to release the names of facilities with coronavirus cases. The data only includes nursing homes that are regulated by CMS. Assisted living facilities, group homes and other long-term care providers are not included.
