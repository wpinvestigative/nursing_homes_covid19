# Coronavirus cases in U.S. nursing homes


The Washington Post’s database contains the names of Medicare-certified nursing homes that have had at least one reported case of the coronavirus among patients or staff as of May 15, 2020.

The Post [began tracking providers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/20/nearly-one-10-nursing-homes-nationwide-report-coronavirus-outbreaks/) in early April when it became clear that nursing homes were at the center of the nation’s coronavirus pandemic. For weeks, the federal government and most states did not publicly report the names of facilities. By culling local news reports, health department data and recently released lists from states – and comparing that information with federal data on nursing homes from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services – The Post was able to identify more than 3,940 nursing homes that have had one or more cases. That is more than 1 in 4 nationwide.

State reporting of impacted nursing homes varies widely. For example, California releases point-in-time data of facilities that currently have active cases. That means that nursing homes with resolved cases no longer appear on California’s list. The Post is keeping a running list of homes that have had one or more cases, even if they are no longer active.

The Post’s data is not complete. It will be updated weekly as more states begin to release the names of facilities with coronavirus cases. The data only includes nursing homes that are regulated by CMS. Assisted living facilities, group homes and other long-term care providers are not included. To alert The Post about a nursing home or another long-term care facility affected by coronavirus, please email Debra.Cenziper@washpost.com
